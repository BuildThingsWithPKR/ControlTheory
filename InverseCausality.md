The inverse G(z)
 of a system H(z)
 is simply

G(z)=1H(z)

The poles of G(z)
 are the zeros of H(z)
 and the zeros of G(z)
 are the poles of H(z)
.

G(z)
 is only stable if the poles are inside the unit circle, which implies that for G(z)
 to be stable, H(z)
 needs have all it's zero inside the unit circle, i.e. it's minimum phase.

So if H(z)
 is causal, stable and minimum phase, it's inverse is also causal stable and minimum phase.
